Problem Definition : With the rise of AI writing tools (e.g., ChatGPT),    plagiarism in school and college 
                     submissions has evolved. Standard tools like Turnitin fail to detect AI-generated original 
                     content. Thus develop a Conference Management ToolKit   for research paper 
                     conference 
Task : “CMT is like a digital detective + supportive teacher for research papers — ensuring originality, spotting AI overuse, and maintaining fairness in academic conferences.”
