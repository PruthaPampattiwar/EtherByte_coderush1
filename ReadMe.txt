Problem Definition : With the rise of AI writing tools (e.g., ChatGPT),    plagiarism in school and college 
                     submissions has evolved. Standard tools like Turnitin fail to detect AI-generated original 
                     content. Thus develop a Conference Management ToolKit   for research paper 
                     conference
